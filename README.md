-- An interactive dummy portfolio web page that has light and dark mode themes, hover effects, time intervals and much more.
-- Use Arrow functions, function Declarations, Event Handlers, Web Api, CSS styling, HTML, Dynamic styling, For Each methods, For Loops and more.

This project was made to showcase I can develop a simple but interactive website. It is desgined to show an individuals history about there work and the projects they created. I learn many things about positioning in CSS, toggling between light and dark theme, hover effects using the dom, and how to organize my functions in Javascript. Overall this project was a great learning experince and fun to make.
